# brewstersRoasts

An exploration of php sessions and databases with a little bit of jquery thrown in. 
Started from this source: https://www.codeofaninja.com/2013/04/shopping-cart-in-php.html, 
and grew it from there. Probably not idiomatic of php or javascript (still learning web-based stuff),
definitely not production standard code. Key word is 'exploration'.
